# GraphiQL Client
**NOTE For Washington DC Users--GraphiQL is now included OOB for W+** Look for "GraphQL Explorer"

A simple ServiceNow GraphiQL implementation that allows you to make queries from within your instance.

Based on the https://github.com/graphql/graphiql repo, specifically the [CDN Example](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/examples/graphiql-cdn).

**Do Not Install on a Prod Instance--for Dev Use Only**

NOTE: An important side-effect of using this versus an external 3rd party tool is the ability to set breakpoints in your resolvers since the session is the same.

## Installation
1. Simply use source control to fork this repo and install that into your ServiceNow instance using Studio. (Use the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.)
2. Make sure that introspection is enabled at "System Web Services > GraphQL > Properties" (NOTE: DO THIS FOR DEV INSTANCES ONLY).  
3. Note: **turning on GlideRecord introspection** means that the *entire* schema of all your tables and fields will be downloaded. Needless to say this will take a couple of minutes each time the schema updates in the client.  If you are not using the GlideRecord_Query API you will want to leave this off, but luckily you only take this hit the first time you load the GraphQL client each day.

## Usage
Navigate to "System Web Services > GraphQL > GraphiQL Explorer" (note the "i" in the name versus the OOB client).

Available at the path:
/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/x_snc_graphiql_gql.do

Type "{" then ctrl-space in the editor and you will see the available GraphQL Services auto complete.

Sample query:

```
query ($limit: Int = 5, $queryConditions: String = "active=true") {
  GlideRecord_Query {
    incident(queryConditions: $queryConditions, pagination: {limit: $limit}) {
      _rowCount
      _results {
        short_description {
          value
        }
        sys_id {
          value
        }
        state {
          value
          displayValue
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
